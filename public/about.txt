I never give up on a deployment. Started with zero no experience, failed the Academy exams three times, and still became the Hokage of backend infrastructure.I build distributed systems the same way I mastered Sage Mode — with patience, practice, and a deep understanding of natural energy (read: system resources).My Shadow Clone Jutsu is basically Kubernetes. Spin up a thousand pods, run parallel workloads, tear them down when the mission is done.
